DECMATH
=====

First off all this library builds upon dmath, a project by Brian Beck <exogen@gmail.com> and Christopher Hesse <christopher.hesse@gmail.com>.

The main goal I have for now is to implement all functions in the standard math library for which it would be useful to have an alternative that uses the Decimal type.

At this point decmath is rather stable but still under heavy development so if you have any suggestions or want to help out with a pull request definitely do so on [GitHub](https://github.com/ElecProg/decmath).
